# Traveling Salesman Problem
This repository contains the code and results from my final project for CBE 449: Numerical and Monte Carlo Methods in Engineering and Scientific Computing (Princeton University, Spring 2024).

## Abstract
I implement simulated annealing, dynamic programming, and brute force methods for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem. I explore different temperature schedules for the simulated annealing method and finds that it greatly outperforms brute force and dynamic programming for large datasets.
